# SnakeGame
A Snake Game in Applesoft

Idea taken from https://thecodingtrain.com/challenges/173-snake-applesoft-basic

Develop on Visual Studio Code with Applesoft Basic Extension from dfgordon
Test on AppleWin

Still in development :
- adding new levels
- adding difficulties with extra walls
- making it in assembler !

Major issue of the game : the longer the snake is, the slowest it moves.

Game goal : you are a snake hungry for apples.
For passing a level, you need to eat a certain number of apples.
Apples appear randomly on the screen. You have limited time to eat one. If you fail to eat in time a new apple will appear !
Each time an apple is eaten, the snake grows.

Controlling the snake is made with <- (left arrow) and -> (right arrow)
If you go up the screen, left arrow makes the snake turns left. But if you go down, left arrow makes the snake goes right.
Pay attention !

Touching walls kills you.
Touching yourself kills you.
